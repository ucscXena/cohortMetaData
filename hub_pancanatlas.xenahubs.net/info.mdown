# [TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/blog/2017/tcga-pancan-atlas)
As its concluding project, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network completes the most comprehensive cross-cancer analysis to date: The [Pan-Cancer Atlas (PanCanAtlas)](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/blog/2017/tcga-pancan-atlas).

From the analysis of over 11,000 tumors from 33 of the most prevalent forms of cancer, the Pan-Cancer Atlas provides a uniquely comprehensive, in-depth, and interconnected understanding of how, where, and why tumors arise in humans. As a singular and unified point of reference, the Pan-Cancer Atlas is an essential resource for the development of new treatments in the pursuit of precision medicine. See the [Pan-Cancer Atlas publications on Cell](http://www.cell.com/pb-assets/consortium/PanCancerAtlas/PanCani3/index.html).

Xena hosts the curated genomics and clinical data generated by the PanCan Atlas consortium working groups. Below are example views of the data.

## Live examples

<figcaption>This is a Xena Visual Spreadsheet view of 7,903 PanCan Atlas samples (rows) by 6 genomics columns. Each row corresponds to a single sample. The first "sample" column is followed by the 6 data columns. The rows are sorted on the left most data column and sub-sorted on subsequent columns. Data columns, starting at the left, are "Stemness score", "TP53 mutation", "gene expression for FOXM1", "scores for various gene programs", "immune subtype", and "cancer type". Higher stemness is indicated with brighter red. Mutations show a gene diagram at the top with exons in alternating light and dark grey boxes. For each sample the position of the mutation is marked in relation to the gene diagram at the top. Mutations are colored by their functional impact with deleterious mutations in red, and missense mutations and in-frame indels in blue. Gene expression is colored red to blue for high to low expression. Gene program score is colored yelow to blue for high to low scores. Immune based subtype and cancer type are colored by their values.</figcaption>
