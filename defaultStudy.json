          "abstract": "To define the cellular composition and architecture of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), we com- bined single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics and multiplexed ion beam imaging from a se- ries of human cSCCs and matched normal skin. cSCC exhibited four tumor subpopulations, three recapitu- lating normal epidermal states, and a tumor-specific keratinocyte (TSK) population unique to cancer, which localized to a fibrovascular niche. Integration of single-cell and spatial data mapped ligand-receptor net- works to specific cell types, revealing TSK cells as a hub for intercellular communication. Multiple features of potential immunosuppression were observed, including T regulatory cell (Treg) co-localization with CD8 T cells in compartmentalized tumor stroma. Finally, single-cell characterization of human tumor xenografts and in vivo CRISPR screens identified essential roles for specific tumor subpopulation-enriched gene net- works in tumorigenesis. These data define cSCC tumor and stromal cell subpopulations, the spatial niches where they interact, and the communicating gene networks that they engage in cancer.",

          "abstract":"Tools to visualize genetic alterations within tissues remain underdeveloped despite the growth of spatial transcriptomic technologies, which measure gene expression in different regions of tissues. Since genetic alterations can be detected in RNA-sequencing data, we explored the feasibility of observing somatic alterations in spatial transcriptomics data. Extracting genetic information from spatial transcriptomic data would illuminate the spatial distribution of clones and allow for correlations with regional changes in gene expression to support genotype- phenotype studies. Recent work demonstrates that copy number alterations can be inferred from spatial transcriptomics data1. Here, we describe new software to further enhance the inference of copy number from spatial transcriptomics data. Moreover, we demonstrate that single nucleotide variants are also detectable in spatial transcriptomic data. We applied these approaches to map the location of point mutations, copy number alterations, and allelic imbalances in spatial transcriptomic data of two cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas. We show that both tumors are dominated by a single clone of cells, suggesting that their regional variations in gene expression2 are likely driven by non-genetic factors. Furthermore, we observe mutant cells in histologically normal tissue surrounding one tumor, which were not discernible upon histopathologic evaluation. Finally, we detected mono-allelic expression of immunoglobulin heavy chains in B-cells, revealing clonal populations of plasma cells surrounding one tumor. In summary, we put forward solutions to add the genetic dimension to spatial transcriptomic datasets, augmenting the potential of this new technology.",
