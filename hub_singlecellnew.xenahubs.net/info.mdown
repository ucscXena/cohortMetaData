Xena is a single cell browser is an online exploration tool for single cell RNA-seq data and associated meta-data and annotations. This browser connects to a Xena data hub that contains single-cell RNA sequencing data from the [Human Cell Atlas (HCA)](https://data.humancellatlas.org/) and other publications. It is built for performance, allowing you to dynamically view 1 million cells at a time. 

Xena's Visual Spreadsheet is analogous to an office spreadsheet: it is a visual representation of a data grid where each column is a slice of genomic data (e.g. a gene or a set of genes' expression, inferred cell type, cell location), and each row is a single cell. Users interactively build their spreadsheet, enabling discovery across multiple genes and cell annotations.

### Gene expression from an HCA 800,000 cell scRNA-seq dataset at a single cell resolution. 

The view displays expression profiles of 24 genes with two cell annotations from the HCA Census of Immune Cells study. The 26-parameter data from all 794,365 cells is held in compressed form in the Browser, with no down-sampling applied in generating the view. Each row across the entire display represents a single cell. Xenaâ€™s public-private data join feature enables users to combine large public resource data, such as the gene expression data from HCA, with their own analysis results, such as the Louvain clusters.

## Future of this tool

This site currently supports the Visual Spreadsheet view and genomic signatures. We are actively working to support more Xena Browser functionalities.
