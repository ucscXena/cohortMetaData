### About Xena
Xena's Visual Spreadsheet is analogous to an office spreadsheet: it is a visual representation of a data grid where each column is a slice of genomic data (e.g. a gene or a set of genes' expression, inferred cell type, cell location), and each row is a single cell.

A live view of annotated cell types and marker genes for NK, macrophage and T cells
