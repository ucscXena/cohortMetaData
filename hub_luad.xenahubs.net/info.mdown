# Comprehensive Characterization of Lung Adenocarcinomas Without Classical Activating Oncogenic Alterations by Whole-Exome and Transcriptome Sequencing

Inspite of utilizing comprehensive next-generation sequencing technologies examining the whole-exome (WES) and transcriptome (RNA-seq), we have been unable to identify activating RTK/RAS/RAF pathway alterations in approximately 20-30% of LUADs (lung adenocarcinoma) samples. To determine the reasons underlying the apparent lack of RAS-pathway oncogenes in these LUADs, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 98 oncogene-negative (ON) LUADs in which RTK/RAS/RAF pathway activating alterations were not readily identified by TCGA through WES and RNA-seq. This site provides interactive visualization and exploration of data and results from this analysis.
