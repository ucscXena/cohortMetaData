# Whole-genome Characterization of Lung Adenocarcinomas Lacking Alterations in RTK/RAS/RAF Pathway

Lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) are typically characterized by genetic activation of the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway.  Through comprehensive genomic analysis, we identified 57 RTK/RAS/RAF alteration negative (RPA-) cases from the TCGA LUAD cohort. Among the 57 RPA- LUAD cases, we identified focal deletions targeting the promoter and transcription start site of tumor suppressor genes in STK11, KEAP1, and SMARCA4. Analysis of non-coding mutations identified a novel promoter hotspot associated with increased expression of ILF2. We implicated specific complex SVs patterns in the high-level amplification of putative and known oncogenes. Expression profiling suggested a TP53-deficient phenotype in RPA- LUADs. TP53-mutant RPA- LUAD cases also harbored a significantly higher burden of simple focal deletions relative to wild-type. Our results provide the first comprehensive genomic characterization of RPA- LUADs, implicating deletion of tumor suppressor genes and complex genomic structural variants in the pathogenesis of this common and difficult to treat patient subset.
