### About Xena
Xena's Visual Spreadsheet is analogous to an office spreadsheet: it is a visual representation of a data grid where each column is a slice of genomic data (e.g. a gene or a set of genes' expression, inferred cell type, cell location), and each row is a single cell.

A live view of annotated cell types and marker genes for rod cells, bipolar neurons and Mueller cells

### To visualize
Click on the "Live view" above or the 'Visualize' button and follow the wizard. You can view phenotype information like cell type, as well as gene expression for a single gene or set of genes.
